## Overview

- Simulated dataset and R Shiny dashborad for visualising data from the article "Towards intercrop ideotypes: non-random trait assembly can promote overyielding and stability of species proportion in simulated legume-based mixtures" (https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/126/4/671/5719429). 
- The dashboard can can be used to teach basic principles of plant-plant interactions, including competition for light and nutrients and N facilitation related to legumes in intercrops.
